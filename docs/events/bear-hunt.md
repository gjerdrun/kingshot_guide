# Bear Hunt

The goal is to do maximum damage on the Bear.

There are two roles: Rally Leaders and Rally Joiners. Rally Leaders should be players with high troop capacity, using the best heroes with the most damage/lethality up they can get. Rally Joiners join the Rally Leaders with heroes having "Lethality" or "Damage up" exploration skills.

=== "Rally Leaders"

    Use
    - Your 3 strongest DPS heroes

    Top picks (per Pitfall guide)
    - Amadeus
    - Zoe
    - Marlin

    Avoid
    - Defense‑only heroes (e.g., Howard)

    Recommended heroes (ranked)
    
    | Rank | Hero    | Why |
    |------|---------|-----|
    | 1    | Amadeus | Offensive expedition skill; high single‑target DPS |
    | 2    | Zoe     | Strong damage ability; outperforms defensive picks |
    | 3    | Marlin  | Offensive expedition skill; reliable boss DPS |

=== "Rally Joiners"

    Lead hero
    - Chenko (lethality buff)

    Other slots
    - Your strongest DPS: Amadeus, Zoe, Marlin

    If joining multiple rallies
    - Send only Chenko to extra rallies unless hero slots are needed for capacity

    Recommended heroes (ranked)
    
    | Rank | Hero    | Role | Why |
    |------|---------|------|-----|
    | 1    | Chenko  | Lead | Lethality up for the rally |
    | 2    | Yeonwoo | DPS  | Lethality up for the rally |
    | 3    | Amadeus | DPS  | Lethality up for the rally |
    | 4    | Zoe     | DPS  | Damage up |
    | 5    | Marlin  | DPS  | Damage dealt chance up |

    - If you do not have any of the above available heroes, just send troops with no hero.
