# Hall of Governors

Hall of Governors (HoG) is a multi-day, bi‑weekly event during early generations where each day focuses on different tasks. Earn milestone rewards by scoring points and compete on the leaderboard for the Hero of the Season.

Notes
- First HoG starts around day 6 after a kingdom opens. Early events feature Amadeus as the Hero of the Season; later events may feature Hilde.

Below you’ll find one tab for each HoG run, and inside it, horizontal tabs for each stage with scoring and quick focus tips.
