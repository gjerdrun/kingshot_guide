# Viking Vengeance

Viking is 20 waves with attacks from angry Vikings.

## Objectives
- Defend player towns with reinforcements.
- In good time before the event, find a companion to trade reinforces with. 
- Empty your city: Send out all troops, especially Infantry and Cavalry, leaving only your top three heroes. This ensures allies get the kills and points.
- Get reinforced: Request reinforcements from other players to reach 200kâ€“250k troops in your city. Recommendation is three players to reinforce each other.
- Reinforce the HQ: On waves 10 and 20, reinforce the Alliance HQ directly to earn extra defense points.
- Don't heal troops: Avoid healing troops during the event, as they will return to your city and "steal" kills from your reinforcing allies, which reduces everyone's points.
